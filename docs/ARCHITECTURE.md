# Morphe Auto Build — Architecture and Contributor Guide

This document explains how the repository works, how sources are selected, how versions are resolved, how APKs are validated and patched, how releases are maintained, and how to add another application.

## 1. Project model

This repository is a configuration-driven GitHub Actions build system.

The intended flow is:

~~~text
apps/*.json
    ↓
app × source architecture (mirror apps default to universal)
    ↓
resolve Morphe patch + supported APK version
    ↓
download exact base package
    ↓
validate package + exact version
    ↓
run Morphe Desktop
    ↓
manifest.json
    ↓
zipalign
    ↓
apksigner
    ↓
verify
    ↓
monthly YYYY-MM release
~~~

The repository should contain automation and configuration, not copies of upstream Morphe patch definitions.

Core invariants:

- An APK version must be supported by the selected Morphe patch.
- A downloaded package must match the requested version.
- Invalid downloads must never reach Morphe.
- manifest.json is authoritative for patch outputs.
- Rebuilding one app/architecture must not delete unrelated release assets.
- Brave ARM64 and ARM32 remain supported.
- CI security controls must not be weakened to make a build pass.

## 3. Application configuration

Every application is normally represented by one file:

~~~text
apps/<id>.json
~~~

The workflow reads the files and automatically creates the build matrix.

A minimal configuration contains:

~~~json
{
  "id": "example",
  "display_name": "Example",
  "package": "com.example.app",
  "patch_repo": "OWNER/example-morphe-patches",
  "allow_experimental": false,
  "source": {},
  "patch_bundle": {
    "type": "prebuilt"
  },
  "flavors": []
}
~~~

Important fields:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| id | Stable application identifier and filename prefix |
| display_name | Human-readable name |
| package | Android package name |
| patch_repo | Morphe patch repository |
| allow_experimental | Permit experimental patch targets |
| source | Base package source |
| patch_bundle | Patch bundle strategy |
| flavors | Output variants |
| enabled | Optional; false excludes the app from the matrix |

Do not add a separate workflow for a normal application.

## 4. Architectures

Architectures are configuration data:

~~~json
"archs": [
  {
    "name": "arm64",
    "asset": "BraveMonoarm64.apk"
  },
  {
    "name": "arm32",
    "asset": "BraveMonoarm.apk"
  }
]
~~~

Multiple entries become multiple GitHub Actions matrix jobs.

### Brave

~~~text
arm64 → arm64-v8a → BraveMonoarm64.apk
arm32 → armeabi-v7a → BraveMonoarm.apk
~~~

ARM32 is a first-class target. Do not remove it when modifying the Brave configuration or workflow.

### Universal contract

`arch: universal` means **both** ARM targets in the same downloaded artifact:

~~~text
arm64-v8a + armeabi-v7a
~~~

It does not mean "prefer arm64" and it does not mean an arm64-only fallback.
The downloader passes the universal request to the provider without replacing
it with a single ABI. After download, `validate_package(..., expected_arch)`
inspects `aapt dump badging` for an APK and every APK entry in an APKM/XAPK.
The audit fails if either ARM ABI is missing. A package with no native code is
architecture-independent and is accepted; extra ABIs such as x86_64 are fine.

If a provider publishes separate arm64 and arm32 assets but no combined asset,
that provider is **not** a valid universal mirror. Keep the failure visible and
let another exact-version universal mirror handle the build; never relabel an
arm64-only file as universal. Mirror-backed app configs do not declare a manual
per-ABI matrix—the shared `universal` contract is implicit.

### Google Photos

Google Photos uses the same implicit universal mirror contract as the other
mirror-backed applications; the selected provider is responsible for supplying
one combined exact-version artifact.

## 5. Source system

The source is selected with source.type.

Supported types:

~~~text
mirrors
apkmirror
github
direct
~~~

### mirrors

Use this when several sources can provide the same exact version.

Current Google Photos order:

~~~text
APKMirror
    ↓ failure
APKPure
    ↓ failure
APKCombo
    ↓ failure
Aptoide
~~~

Every candidate is resolved at its exact version through the
[apkd](https://github.com/Fahry-a/apkd) library
(`apkd @ git+https://github.com/Fahry-a/apkd` in requirements.txt),
downloaded to a temporary .partial file and validated before it becomes
the final package. A `mirrors` source does not declare `source.archs`; its
architecture contract is implicitly `universal`.

### APKMirror

Standalone `source.type == "apkmirror"` configs still use tools/apkmirror.py:

~~~text
variant page
  → version/detail page
  → download confirmation
  → final URL
  → package
~~~

It normally uses curl_cffi and can use Playwright Chromium for browser-based Cloudflare handling. The native apkd mirror provider does not silently bypass a challenge: a `403`/Turnstile response is reported as `APKMirror Cloudflare/Turnstile challenge`, so the target can be completed manually in a browser and retried. A challenge is not evidence that the package lacks a universal ABI.

Configuration normally supplies:

- variant_url
- slug_filter
- version_slug
- file_type

The downloader must honor the exact requested version.

`source.type == "mirrors"` entries with `{"type": "apkmirror"}` go through
apkd instead and only need the org/repo slug:

~~~json
{"type": "apkmirror", "org": "admtorrent", "repo": "advanced-download-manager"}
~~~

or `{"type": "apkmirror", "slug": "admtorrent/advanced-download-manager"}`.
`variant_url` / `slug_filter` / `version_slug` are not used here — apkd
discovers the real variants URL from the repo version listing (the display
slug often differs from the repo slug: `x-` vs `twitter`,
`google-photos-` vs `photos`) and filters arch/dpi client-side.

Optional per-mirror hints: `arch`, `dpi`, `min_sdk`. `dpi` defaults to
`"any"` (APKMirror rows are usually density-scoped like `120-640dpi`, so
`nodpi`-only would match nothing). The legacy standalone APKMirror source may
use a concrete ABI override; the mirror dispatcher itself always keeps its
implicit `universal` contract and never retries as `arm64-v8a`. When the exact
version only ships as a bundle, the mirror must expose a compatible bundle
container; APKM and XAPK are equivalent bundle labels, while an APK is not
accepted for a bundle-only request.

Bundle-sourced apps declare it at the source level instead — ADM and X use
`"file_type": "apkm"`, so the base file is `base.apkm`, validation checks
the inner `base.apk` version with aapt, and Morphe merges the splits before
patching (verified locally: ADM 14.0.39 `.apkm` patches cleanly into an
unsigned APK). Per-mirror `file_type` still overrides per mirror, so APK
mirrors stay usable as fallback wherever they serve the same version as APK.

### APKPure

APKPure is handled by tools/mirror_download.py via apkd.

The downloader resolves the requested application version and extracts its package URL. It must not silently replace the requested version with latest.

APKPure serves both monolithic APK and XAPK bundle assets. Both are accepted; the asset type matching the app config's file_type is preferred, so XAPK-only releases (e.g. Native Camera) download and validate as bundles.

### APKCombo

APKCombo is handled by tools/mirror_download.py via apkd.

The downloader searches by package name, resolves the exact requested
version (including old-versions), picks the matching arch variant, then
validates the resulting package.

Uptodown was previously removed because its final file URL is issued after a
Cloudflare Turnstile flow. It is now available again only as an explicit,
browser-assisted provider; it is not part of the default unattended fallback
order.

### Aptoide

Aptoide is accessed through its public API.

The downloader finds the requested vername, obtains the corresponding vercode, requests metadata and downloads the returned package path.

### Uptodown

Uptodown is an opt-in, browser-assisted provider. Its public version metadata
is resolved normally, but the final file URL is issued only after an
interactive Cloudflare Turnstile flow. Use the local helper rather than
unattended CI:

~~~bash
python tools/uptodown_browser.py com.pinterest \
  --version 14.34.0 --app-slug pinterest --prefer-xapk \
  --output /tmp/pinterest-14.34.0.xapk
~~~

The helper opens a visible Playwright Chromium window, waits for the operator
to complete the normal challenge, captures Uptodown's download response, and
then runs the same exact-version and universal ABI validation as the build.
No third-party CAPTCHA solver is used. The Pinterest Uptodown entry remains
`enabled: false` until this flow has produced and validated a real artifact.

### Live mirror audit

The production fallback chain and the live audit have different jobs:

~~~text
production build:
  configured order → first valid exact package → patch

live audit:
  every configured mirror → independent exact package download → report
~~~

`tools/mirror_probe.py` discovers mirror targets from `apps/*.json`; it does
not contain an application allowlist. For each target it:

1. Resolves the patch-supported version once per app.
2. Calls the existing `download_from_mirror` implementation for that provider.
3. Validates the configured package type, exact version and ARM contract with `aapt`.
4. Records size, ZIP entries, SHA-256, duration and the error, if any.
5. Removes temporary downloads after validation unless `--download-dir` is set.

A provider failure does not prevent the remaining targets from being tested.
The command exits non-zero after the complete run, so GitHub Actions shows a
real provider regression instead of hiding it behind fallback. A mirror entry
may set `enabled: false` when it is intentionally retained as documentation but
must not be treated as an active build source or audit target.

Run it with:

~~~bash
python tools/mirror_probe.py --report mirror-report.json
python tools/mirror_probe.py --config apps/x.json --mirror apkcombo
~~~

The `Live Mirror Downloads` workflow builds its matrix from the same discovery
function. It runs on configuration/tool/test/workflow changes, weekly on a
schedule, and via `workflow_dispatch`; this makes adding a new mirror-backed
application configuration-only from a CI perspective.

### Per-mirror package types

Mirror configurations may override the source-level package type with their own `file_type`. This is useful when different mirrors publish the same application version in different package formats.

Example:

~~~json
{
  "type": "mirrors",
  "file_type": "apk",
  "mirrors": [
    {
      "type": "apkpure",
      "name": "pinterest",
      "file_type": "xapk"
    },
    {
      "type": "apkcombo",
      "name": "pinterest",
      "file_type": "xapk"
    },
    {
      "type": "aptoide",
      "file_type": "apk"
    }
  ]
}
~~~

The effective package type is resolved in this order:

~~~text
mirror.file_type
       ↓ if absent
source.file_type
       ↓ if absent
apk
~~~

The selected type is used both when choosing a mirror asset and when validating the downloaded package. This prevents a bundle such as XAPK from being treated as a monolithic APK. The CLI writes the successful artifact to a path with the selected extension and publishes that actual `base_file`/`file_type` pair to GitHub Actions, so a mirror-level override remains consistent through patching.

For example, a Pinterest configuration can explicitly document:

| Mirror | Format that is validated |
| --- | --- |
| APKPure | XAPK |
| APKCombo | XAPK |
| Aptoide | APK |

This also handles mirrors that return a bundle for a requested version. The package validator must validate the configured bundle type rather than only checking for an APK root manifest.


### GitHub

Use:

~~~json
"source": {
  "type": "github",
  "repo": "OWNER/REPOSITORY",
  "tag_prefix": "v",
  "file_type": "apk",
  "archs": [
    {
      "name": "arm64",
      "asset": "ExampleArm64.apk"
    }
  ]
}
~~~

tools/github_source.py resolves the exact release tag and exact asset name using the GitHub API.

This is currently used for Brave.

### Direct

Use a direct source for a known URL pattern:

~~~json
"source": {
  "type": "direct",
  "file_type": "xapk",
  "archs": [
    {
      "name": "universal",
      "url": "https://example.invalid/releases/{version}/{package}-{version}.xapk"
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Supported placeholders:

- {version}
- {package}
- {arch}

tools/direct.py downloads to .partial, validates the package and exact version, then atomically moves it into place.

## 6. Version resolution

tools/resolve_version.py is the authority for selecting the application version.

Conceptually:

~~~text
patch repository
    ↓
prebuilt MPP release
    ↓
patches-list.json
    ↓
matching Android package
    ↓
stable/experimental filtering
    ↓
highest supported target
~~~

The resolver returns the MPP version, MPP URL and supported APK version.

There is deliberately no arbitrary application-version input.

This prevents a user from forcing an APK version that the selected Morphe patch does not declare as compatible.

Experimental targets are excluded unless enabled through configuration or the manual allow_experimental input.

## 7. Package validation

tools/common.py provides shared validation.

Validation checks:

1. Minimum file size.
2. Valid ZIP structure.
3. APK contains AndroidManifest.xml.
4. APKM/XAPK contains APK entries.
5. Exact version can be read with aapt.
6. Detected version equals the requested resolver version.
7. Universal packages contain both arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a.

For a bundle, base.apk is preferred; otherwise the first APK entry is checked.

This is important because HTTP 200 does not mean "valid APK". A server can return HTML, Cloudflare content, a partial download or the wrong release with status 200.

Validation must happen before Morphe.

## 8. Patching and manifest

tools/patch.py invokes Morphe Desktop once for every configured flavor.

A flavor contains:

~~~json
{
  "name": "special",
  "description": "Special patch combination",
  "patch_include": [
    "Patch A",
    "Patch B"
  ],
  "output_suffix": "-special"
}
~~~

Morphe produces unsigned APKs.

tools/patch.py writes manifest.json containing the files actually produced.

Later stages use the manifest rather than reconstructing filenames.

This is important because the patcher, not the workflow's assumptions, is the authority on which files exist.

## 9. Signing

The final order is:

~~~text
Morphe unsigned APK
    ↓
zipalign
    ↓
apksigner
    ↓
apksigner verify
    ↓
final APK
~~~

The workflow must not rewrite the APK ZIP after zipalign. Repacking after alignment can invalidate the alignment.

The release keystore comes from GitHub Actions secrets and is deleted after signing.

## 10. Morphe CLI integrity

The workflow pins the Morphe Desktop version:

~~~text
MORPHE_CLI_VERSION=1.16.0
~~~

The exact JAR is SHA-256 verified before it is executed.

When upgrading Morphe:

1. Choose the intended official release.
2. Obtain the checksum for the exact JAR.
3. Update version and checksum together.
4. Run tests.
5. Review the workflow diff.
6. Verify the resulting CI run.

Do not remove checksum validation as a workaround.

## 11. Monthly release system

Release tags use:

~~~text
YYYY-MM
~~~

tools/monthly_release.py updates one app/architecture at a time.

For a new build it:

1. Uploads current APKs with --clobber.
2. Finds stale assets using the current app + architecture prefix.
3. Deletes only those stale assets.
4. Replaces only the marked release-note section for that app/architecture.
5. Preserves unrelated assets and release-note sections.

Example:

~~~text
Brave ARM64 rebuilt
    ↓
old brave-arm64 assets may be removed

Brave ARM32
Google Photos
other applications
    ↓
must remain
~~~

## 12. Existing-release optimization

Before downloading or patching, the workflow calculates the expected output names from the application configuration and resolved version.

If every expected asset already exists in the current monthly release, that matrix job is skipped.

Use:

~~~text
rebuild=true
~~~

when a manual rebuild is required.

This optimization exists to avoid expensive downloads and patch operations.

## 13. Adding a new application

### Step 1: Verify Morphe support

Confirm:

- patch repository
- prebuilt MPP release
- patches-list.json
- Android package name
- supported application versions

Do not guess compatibility.

### Step 2: Choose a source

Prefer an existing generic source type.

Use:

- github for GitHub release assets
- mirrors for fallback mirrors
- apkmirror for APKMirror-specific configuration
- direct for a known URL pattern

Only add downloader code when the existing generic sources cannot represent the source.

### Step 3: Create apps/<id>.json

Example:

~~~json
{
  "id": "example",
  "display_name": "Example",
  "package": "com.example.app",
  "patch_repo": "OWNER/example-morphe-patches",
  "allow_experimental": false,
  "source": {
    "type": "github",
    "repo": "OWNER/example",
    "tag_prefix": "v",
    "file_type": "apk",
    "archs": [
      {
        "name": "arm64",
        "asset": "ExampleArm64.apk"
      }
    ]
  },
  "patch_bundle": {
    "type": "prebuilt"
  },
  "flavors": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "description": "Default patches",
      "patch_include": [],
      "output_suffix": ""
    }
  ]
}
~~~

### Step 4: Test version resolution

~~~bash
python3 tools/resolve_version.py   --config apps/example.json
~~~

### Step 5: Test the downloader

GitHub:

~~~bash
python3 tools/github_source.py   --config apps/example.json   --arch arm64   --apk-version <version>   --output base.apk
~~~

Mirrors:

~~~bash
python3 tools/mirror_download.py   --config apps/example.json   --arch universal   --exact-version <version>   --output base.apk
~~~

### Step 6: Add regression tests

Test exact-version behavior and failure cases for any new downloader behavior.

### Step 7: Run the complete test suite

~~~bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
~~~

### Step 8: Update README

Add the application, source order, architectures and flavors to the supported-app documentation.

## 14. Adding a flavor

Normally this requires only configuration:

~~~json
{
  "name": "special",
  "description": "Special patches",
  "patch_include": [
    "Patch A"
  ],
  "output_suffix": "-special"
}
~~~

The generic workflow automatically patches, signs and publishes it.

## 15. Adding a mirror

A new mirror implementation must:

1. Resolve the exact requested version.
2. Return a package URL.
3. Download to .partial.
4. Validate package shape.
5. Validate exact version.
6. Remove partial files after failure.
7. Have regression tests.
8. Be added to configuration in the intended fallback order.
9. Be documented.

Never use "latest" as an implicit fallback for an exact-version request.

## 16. Local development with uv

Python dependencies are installed with uv.

~~~bash
uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt
~~~

Install Playwright Chromium:

~~~bash
python -m playwright install chromium --with-deps
~~~

Run tests:

~~~bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
~~~

CI uses the SHA-pinned astral-sh/setup-uv action.

## 17. Local build requirements

A complete build environment needs:

- Python 3.12+
- uv
- Java 21+
- Android build tools containing aapt, zipalign and apksigner
- Chromium for the Playwright fallback
- Morphe Desktop JAR
- compatible Morphe MPP
- GitHub CLI for release maintenance

Signing secrets are only expected in GitHub Actions.

## 18. Testing strategy

Tests cover:

- architecture selection
- multi-architecture requirements
- APK shape validation
- APKM/XAPK shape validation
- exact APK version validation
- exact bundle version validation
- patch target selection
- experimental target selection
- Aptoide exact-version lookup
- configuration-driven mirror target discovery and independent live reports
- stale release assets
- cumulative release-note sections

Run:

~~~bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
# network-backed; downloads every configured mirror target
python tools/mirror_probe.py --report mirror-report.json
~~~

When fixing a real bug, add a regression test before considering the fix complete.

## 19. CI security

Preserve:

- contents: read by default
- write permission only in the publish job
- SHA-pinned Actions
- signing secrets outside the repository
- package validation
- exact-version validation
- Morphe CLI checksum verification
- workflow concurrency
- separate test workflow

Do not fix CI by disabling validation, exposing secrets, removing tests or using unverified critical binaries.

## 20. Common failure modes

### HTTP 200 but Morphe fails

Check whether the downloaded file is HTML, a Cloudflare response, a partial file, the wrong package or the wrong version.

### Wrong application version

Fix source resolution. Do not accept the wrong version.

### Unsupported patch target

The selected APK version is not declared compatible by the patch. Do not invent the pairing.

### Brave ARM32 missing

Check apps/brave.json for:

~~~json
{
  "name": "arm32",
  "asset": "BraveMonoarm.apk"
}
~~~

Then confirm the matrix includes arm32.

### Release deletes another application

Check tools/monthly_release.py. Stale deletion must be limited to the current app and architecture.

### APK is not aligned

The final sequence must remain:

~~~text
zipalign → apksigner → apksigner verify
~~~

No ZIP rewrite belongs after zipalign.

## 21. Change checklist

Before opening a PR:

- Inspect current GitHub state.
- Prefer configuration over duplicated workflow code.
- Preserve patch/application compatibility.
- Preserve exact package validation.
- Preserve Brave ARM64 and ARM32.
- Keep manifest.json authoritative.
- Preserve unrelated monthly release assets.
- Keep Actions SHA-pinned.
- Keep permissions least-privilege.
- Do not commit secrets.
- Add regression tests for meaningful bugs.
- Run the full test suite.
- Update documentation for behavior changes.
- Review CI impact.

## 22. Current supported applications

### Google Photos

~~~text
Package:       com.google.android.apps.photos
Patch repo:    Akash-Sriram/morphe-google-photos
Sources:       APKMirror → APKPure → APKCombo → Aptoide
Architecture:  universal
Flavors:       mod, original
~~~

### Brave Browser

~~~text
Package:       com.brave.browser
Patch repo:    kveld9/kveld-morphe-patches
Source:        brave/brave-browser GitHub releases
Architectures: arm64, arm32

arm64 → BraveMonoarm64.apk
arm32 → BraveMonoarm.apk
~~~

### Mirror-backed applications

The remaining enabled applications are discovered from their JSON files and
use the same mirror dispatcher:

| Application | Package | Patch repository | Mirrors | Format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AudioRelay | `com.azefsw.audioconnect` | `kiraio-moe/Lain-Patches` | APKPure → APKCombo → Aptoide | APK |
| Native Camera | `com.rawcam.app` | `WaggBR/Wagg13Patch_Morphe` | APKPure → APKCombo → Aptoide | XAPK |
| Pinterest | `com.pinterest` | `browzomje/browzomje-patches` | APKMirror → APKCombo → APKPure → Aptoide | APK |
| Advanced Download Manager | `com.dv.adm` | `arandomhooman/hoomans-morphe-patches` | APKMirror → APKPure → APKCombo → Aptoide | APKM |
| X / Twitter | `com.twitter.android` | `crimera/piko` | APKMirror → APKPure → APKCombo → Aptoide | APKM |

All of these use `source.type: mirrors` and the implicit universal contract;
they do not carry a hand-written per-ABI `source.archs` list. The live audit
discovers them from the same files rather than maintaining a second hardcoded
list.

## 23. Guiding principle

Keep this repository a thin automation layer around upstream Morphe metadata and application sources.

Prefer:

~~~text
new application configuration
+
generic source behavior
+
regression test
~~~

over:

~~~text
new workflow
+
copied patch definitions
+
application-specific assumptions
~~~
